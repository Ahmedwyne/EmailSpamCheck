# EmailSpamCheck
This repository showcases a machine learning project focused on detecting spam emails using various classification algorithms. The aim is to classify emails as either "spam" or "not spam" based on their content and metadata.

Features:
    Dataset: Utilizes a labeled email dataset containing both spam and legitimate emails for training and evaluation.
    Text Preprocessing: Techniques for cleaning and transforming email text, including tokenization, stop word removal, and vectorization.
    Classification Algorithms: Implementation of multiple algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to evaluate their effectiveness in spam detection.
    Model Evaluation: Assessment of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


Usage:
    Run the Jupyter notebook:
    jupyter notebook
